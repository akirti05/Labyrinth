Each letter describes the same day.
The details change depending on who writes it.
Everyone believes their version is correct.

I wrote this letter while feeling angry.
My emotions guided what I noticed.
Other details did not matter to me.

Someone else remembers the same event calmly.
Their focus was on different moments.
Their truth feels different from mine.

No one is lying on purpose.
Feelings shape how events are remembered.
That is why the letters disagree.

All letters share the same timeline.
The facts overlap.
The opinions do not.
