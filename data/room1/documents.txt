I wrote my name here so I would not forget it.
But the name feels strange when I read it again.
I do not remember writing this note.

The notes on the table say different things.
One says I was calm.
Another says I was scared.
Both are written by me.

I keep a diary to track my days.
Sometimes I read entries I do not remember.
It feels like parts of my memory are missing.

These notes are all in the same handwriting.
They do not agree with each other.
The problem does not feel intentional.

I leave reminders for myself.
Without them, I feel lost.
My memory does not stay clear for long.

Everything feels familiar and unfamiliar at the same time.
My thoughts do not stay in one place.
Something is wrong with my memory.
