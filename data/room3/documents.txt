I remember the same moments differently now.
Nothing outside has changed.
Only how I feel has shifted.

Fear made everything feel urgent.
Sadness made memories heavier.
Calm made the same events feel distant.

The events were real.
The emotions changed how I understood them.
That is why everything felt confusing.

I was not losing reality.
I was reacting emotionally.
My feelings shaped my memory.

Once I name the emotion,
the confusion fades.
Nothing else needs to be unlocked.
